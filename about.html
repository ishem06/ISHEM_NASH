        <h1>THE BEGINNING</h1>
        <p><b>
           Gina B. Paden embarked on a new culinary journey on January 25, 2024, with the inauguration of MG Foodhub and Unli Wings. Despite her prior experience in the food selling, having managed an ihaw-ihaw stall, Gina hesitated initially about diving back into the realm of food entrepreneurship. The closure of her ihaw-ihaw stall was sudden, prompted by a decision to prioritize her successful spa business, "Jeng's Spa," which flourished with three established branches in Bay, Laguna. </p>
           <br>
           <br>
           <br>
           <br>
           <br>
           <p>However, Gina's love for cooking and entrepreneurial spirit brought her back to the kitchen. With her family's support, including her children and husband, she opened MG Foodhub and Unli Wings. Together, they created a place where people could enjoy endless servings of delicious wings and other tasty dishes.</p>

           <br>
           <br>
           <br>
           <p>
            Despite the doubts at first, Gina and her family worked hard to make MG Foodhub and Unli Wings successful. Now, it's a thriving testament to their determination and teamwork. Customers love the delicious food, and Gina is happy to be back in the food business, doing what she loves.</b></p>
